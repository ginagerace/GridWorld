# GridWorld
In GridWorld, every person is a number and lives in a square on a grid. Each person is individually identified by a number (beginning at 0) and lives in only one district at a time.

The world is created given a world size, initial population, and a flag specifying if the inital population should be randomly distributed.

A handful of abstract data types exist that must adhere to certain runtime requirements.
